# UI / UX Improvements suggestions

Here are a few UI/UX improvements suggestions after looking at the design and building this implementation

 1. The ”+ Add New Client” Button: We could simplify this by removing either the “+” sign or the “Add” text to reduce redundancy and free up space.
 2. We could redesign the "unsaved notes" column to better suit potential long-form content. For example, it could be displayed as a link that either redirects to another application or opens a modal to show the full content.
 3. Table Row Selection: If deactivating a client isn’t the only action we might want to support, we could consider adding an action menu to offer more options.
 4.“Extra Notes” Field in the New Client Form: We could use a textarea with a default size that visually indicates that the content can span multiple lines.
 5.Couple Selection in the New Client Form:
        • We could improve the naming for the individuals, replacing “Name 1” and “Name 2” with more descriptive labels.
        • The diagnosis selection could be implemented as a combobox (select + search) to make it easier to find options in large lists.
 6.Client Type in the "new client" Form: Since the form currently supports only two client types, but the table shows five types, we could use a dropdown/select field in the form if more types are to be added later.
